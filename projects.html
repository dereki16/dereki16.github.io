              <p> In this immersive post-apocalyptic world, see if you have what it takes to survive. Uncontained features room unlocking, barricade building, zombie shooting fun. <br> This is a VR game I developed in Unity with help from Hannah Dale as the level designer / art director, Andrew Aguas as the audio editor, and free assets.</p>
              <p class="bold"> Features</p>
              <p> • Object Pooling to create and store multiple game objects. <br> • Navigation and pathfinding so zombies can chase and attack player. <br> • XR plug-in framework to help support VR. <br> • Randomization of goals to help with replayability. <br> • Interactive tutorial to help teach player how they can engage with the world. <br> • Options menu that allows player to choose between different styles of orientation and turning speed. <br> • UI for win case, lose case, main and pause menu.</p>

                <!-- <p> Virtual Aquarium Tank System or VATS was my Capstone project for college, that I along with Isaac Torres and Lewis Truong completed. We were in talks with the Monterey Bay Aquarium to have this simulation be featured; however, communication fell through due to COVID. Even the best aquariums in the world can't exhibit deep sea dwellers or behemoths such as the blue whale. It'd be impractical.</p>
                <p> Our goal was to create a virtual tank where all sorts of sea life can be viewed with ease. The fish are able to swim around through the use of Boids in Explore mode and provide a snippet of information on the individual fish model when clicked on.</p>
                <p> I created the Fish Evalutaion Vector (FEV) which was meant to provide more in depth knowledge on the sea life we were able to obtain. I was able to display this information by utilizing JSON files.</p> -->
                <p class="bold"> Responsibilities</p>
                <p> • Create the Fish Evaluation Vector (FEV) meant to provide in depth knowledge on sea life. <br> • This was accomplished through the use of JSON files. <br> • Provide responsive UI that swaps through the different models and information. <br> • Lay out a list view that allows for an easier browse through different sea life. <br> • Acquire models and undertake a fair amount of research. <br> • Add post processing effects to elicit a deeper blue color for the look of the ocean.</p>

              <p class="bold"> Features</p>
              <p> • Object pooling to instantiate and store obstacles. <br> • Color randomization per obstacle as well as a complimentary secondary color. <br> • Camera shake on collision. <br> • Four sets of speed for obstacles to travel at depending on boost. <br> • Custom sound effects.</p>

              <p> O-Pong was the first original game I completed. I had a great deal of love and respect for the original. Its simple, yet challenging and fun. I was inspired to take a unique spin on the idea by making the playing field ovular. <br> I also made it possible to rotate your paddle to position the ball in a difficult to reach spot, and teleport from one end to another.</p>            
              <p class="bold"> Features</p>
              <p> • The use of spline for players' paddles to follow. <br> • Randomized position for ball to spawn in, as well as direction to follow. <br> • Options menu allowing player to change both player's and ball's speed. <br> • Custom sound effects. </p>
              <p class="bold"> Controls</p>
              <p> • P1: WS to move up and down. AD to rotate paddles. <br> • P2: Arrow keys to do the same. <br> • Spacebar to pause.</p>
