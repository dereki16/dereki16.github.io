                    <!-- <p>Hello and welcome to my website! <br><br> Born and raised in Southern California, I completed my Bachelors at Cal State University, Monterey Bay with a specialization in Game Development. Game dev is my medium of choice for innovation. That passion extends to web and app development as well. <br><br> Having finally created a few games as well as one in VR, I am well aware that it takes a lot of work to have a completed, polished game. I want to constantly improve upon my skills and knowledge, and realize there's always going to be another plateau to overcome. However, I believe with a rich learning environment as well as my patience and determination, the possibilities are endless. <br><br> As much as I enjoy creating, my love for video games doesn't stop there. I grew up on Super Smash Bros Melee, playing with friends and family. Shot my way through multiple apocalypses in the likes of Left 4 Dead and Dead Space. Ventured through a galaxy full of mystery and wonder in Outer Wilds. The list goes on. </p> -->
                    <!-- I began my venture into game dev with O-Pong. I wanted to take the classic and give it a fun twist. Getting that first project done was an important step. Since then, I fell in love with the process. Brainstorming ways to make a well-rounded game such as having a zombie coming at you in the main menu. Giving life to a whole new world really. <br><br>  -->
