                    <p>Hello and welcome to my website. <br><br> I was born and raised in Southern California. Completed my Bachelors at Cal State University, Monterey Bay with a specialization in Game Development. I've always thought of myself as creative, having drawn a lot since young. As a kid, I had this idea, that one day I'd be able to fully immerse myself into a video game. I kept it to myself, so I could one day bring that vision to life. <br><br> Having finally created a few games as well as one in VR, I now know that its going to take a lot of work to have a completed, polished game. Game dev has become my medium of choice for innovation. I want to constantly improve upon my skills and knowledge, and realize there's always going to be another plateu to overcome. However, I believe with some help from a guiding hand as well as my patience and determination, the possibilities are endless. <br><br> I began my venture into game dev with O-Pong. I wanted to take the classic and give it a fun twist. Getting that first project done was an important step. Since then, I fell in love with the process. Brainstorming ways to make a well-rounded game such as having a zombie coming at you in the main menu. Giving life to a whole new world really. <br><br> My love for video games doesn't stop there. I grew up on Super Smash Bros Melee, playing with friends and family. Shot my way through multiple apocalypses in the likes of Left 4 Dead and Dead Space. Ventured through a galaxy full of mystery and wonder in Outer Wilds. The list goes on. </p>
